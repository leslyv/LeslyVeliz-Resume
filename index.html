        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I am a first year pre-business student at UCR. I am a first-generation college student who immigrated from Guatemala at just 3 years old. With much to prove and many expectations to fulfill, I plan to accomplish many goals. Ever since I was younger, my parents always taught me to work hard for what I want. They demonstrated a great example of this every single day, as they are the most hard working people I know. Since coming to the United States, they both have done whatever it took to move forward in life. My parents have always valued the teachings that come with discipline and hard work. With this being said, they would take my brothers' and I along to work with them from time to time. At their jobs as janitors, we were taught the true meaning of hard work. My parents made sure they properly explained all of their responsibilities to us and made sure we also executed them correctly. All this time helping my parents at their job taught me what true work ethic is. I can confidently say that this experience prepared me for my first actual job that I eventually got in the future. I could not be any more grateful for the lessons and morals my parents have implemented in me. <br><br>

        Before being admitted to University of California, Riverside, I worked at my first real job. At 16 years old, I started working at McDonald's. I am beyond grateful for this job as it taught me many valuable life and professional skills. Skills such as proper customer service, experience with cashiers, and maintaining a clean environment at all times. I would describe my first job as a great learning experience. All my time working at that establishment taught me to be a better employee and one day, even a better boss. With much self-discipline, I successfully juggled both school and work. I managed to save enough money to put me through my first year of college, with the help of financial aid as well. <br><br>

        In addition to school and work, I was also involved in a school club. I was a member of Link Crew for two consecutive years. Link Crew needed much of my time both during school and after school. This club taught me many organizational and leadership skills. I also learned some helpful marketing skills, as we were constantly asked to fundraise for good causes. 
        With all the valuable skills I have obtained over the course of my life, I plan to accomplish great things at the University of California, Riverside and beyond. I plan on obtaining my Bachelors degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. With this degree I hope to one day be a great Chief Financial Advisor of a successful firm, or even maybe my own business. While obtaining my degree, I also hope to contribute to the university. I plan on joining multiple school organizations and clubs that will increase my involvement in school and benefit both UCR and myself. I love being a highlander and hope to make UCR proud!
